                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Bestselling author Kristie Sullivan teamed up with her teenaged daughter Grace to deliver the ultimate keto family cookbook, Growing Up Keto. This inspiring new book stems from Kristie’s personal struggles with growing up obese and then finally finding the right nutritional path for herself and, eventually, her family. The keto lifestyle proved to be the right fit for Kristie, who experienced dramatic weight loss and optimized health. Above and beyond being a success story, Kristie is a busy working mom who is devoted to the health of her two children. When she saw her own daughter begin to struggle with weight just as she had as a child, Kristie committed to supporting her by providing delicious low-carb options, focusing on health instead of weight, and setting an example. With her mother’s guidance, Grace made the choice to adopt a keto lifestyle herself, and after six years of success, this mother-and-daughter duo bring to you a first-of-its-kind cookbook dedicated to young adults, teens, kids, and—you guessed it—their moms and dads!  <br><br>Growing Up Keto combines the Sullivans’ heartwarming family narrative with a practical, safe, and kid-friendly approach to adopting a low-carb, ketogenic lifestyle. The recipes featured in the book were created with the health needs and tastes of kids and teens in mind. Some are so simple that youngsters can take over in the kitchen with little or no help from mom or dad. There are also recipes for celebrations with extended family and friends and meals that parents and kids can cook together, making even simple weeknight dinners more fun.  <br><br>Kristie also includes useful tools and information for parents of kids who eat keto, such as tips and tricks for surviving sleepovers, camp, and other social activities that involve food as well as a guide to helping kids make independent and informed choices for a lifetime of healthy eating.  <br><br>Growing Up Keto is complete with breakfasts, including quick morning meals; lunches, including handy tips on packing for school and overnight trips; main dishes, including celebratory meals; and, of course, classic desserts that kids love. With plenty of options for a wide range of palates, Kristie and Grace leave nothing out. Kids and adults alike will feel satisfied, happy, and healthy!  <br><br>Sample Recipes Include:<br><br>Sheet Pan Blueberry Pancakes <br>Three Amigos Dip<br>Roasted Marinated Cheese<br>Pizza Soup<br>Sheet Pan Fajitas<br>Marinated Beef Kabobs, <br>Cashew Chicken<br>Double Stuffed Chocolate Waffle<br>Pumpkin Spice Roll and many more!</p>
